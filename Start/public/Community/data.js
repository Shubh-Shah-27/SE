        title: "Amazon Interview Experience for SDE (On-Campus) 2022",
        topic: `<p>There were totally 4 rounds (1 Online Assessment + 3 Technical Interviews)</p>
        <p>Round 1 (Online Assessment): The Interviews were conducted on the Amazon Chime platform.</p>
        Coding questions were asked to code on Amazon’s LiveCode platform. Each interview round was approx. 1 hr each.</p>
        <p>It had 3 sections:</p>
        <ol>Coding Assessment: coding section using C, C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, Objective C, Python, Ruby, Scala, or Swift (70 minutes).</ol>
        <ol>SDE Work Simulation: The work simulation is an interactive video simulation of a day in the life of an SDE at Amazon. (120 minutes )</ol>
        <ol>Workstyles Assessment: This is built around Amazon’s Leadership Principles (10-15 minutes)</ol>

        <p>In the coding round, there were 2 coding questions of Easy level difficulty.</p>

        <p>Round 2 (Technical Interview):</p>

        <p>Almost the same as https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-itinerary-from-a-given-list-of-tickets/ with O(n) approach </p> 
Multi-source BFS problem similar to: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-time-required-so-that-all-oranges-become-rotten/ 
<p>Round 3 (Technical Interview):

</p><p>Remove K duplicate elements: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reduce-the-string-by-removing-k-consecutive-identical-characters/ 
</p><p>– I gave stack approach in O(n), She was satisfied with the solution. 
 https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-cost-to-merge-numbers-from-1-to-n/ 
 </p><p>Round 4 (Technical Interview):

 </p><p> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-an-array-arr-find-the-maximum-j-i-such-that-arrj-arri/ 
 </p><p>There was a lot of discussion on this problem and the reasoning for why my solution works. 
 The interviewer was quite supportive and was satisfied with my approach (using prefix min. and suffix max. arrays).  

He asked me a medium-difficulty question in the end as the first question took a lot of time: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/median-of-stream-of-integers-running-integers/ 
I came up with the solution quickly but could have written even simpler code with the same logic. Then he asked a few behavioral questions based on Amazon’s Leadership Principles like: 

Tell me a situation where you have to do a quick fix and know it’s not the best approach.
Tell me a situation when you took leadership of your team. and a few more.
PS: I don’t remember behavioral questions exactly. I have prepared a couple of good experiences from my internships for answering them. 
</p><p>
Tips:

Communication is very important, Don’t stay silent and keep your interviewer in sync both with your approach and with the code you are writing.
If you propose a new approach, make sure you have reasoning for why it is better than the previous one.
Start with the Brute Force Approach. It’s completely fine to take a few minutes to think of the optimal solution, but make sure to tell your interviewer the same (that you need a few minutes to think).
Be open-minded and try to grab the hints given by the interviewer.
Be clear with Time and Space complexity as almost all the time you need to explain them for your approach.</p>`,

        title: "Apple Interview Experience for Software Developer 2020",
        topic: `<p>I’m a Microsoft Software Engineer at Microsoft. I work in the field of Azure Psychological Services and I absolutely love my job. 
        I have 9 years of development experience and 3 years of Sys manager experience. I have worked on many groups and products. 
        I started my development career as a device designer at Intel, moved to SQL server at Microsoft (I didn’t like it), 
        went to Content Management Services, and then went to Cognitive Services (AI). I also had a brief stay in Lyft 
        (7 months. I hate it.)</p>
        <p>
        Apple
        Phone Screen: I went to Apple through Triplebyte and skipped the Phone interview.
        Onsite(Video Conference):
        </p>
        <p>Round 1: 
        Given a Tic Tac Toe board, verify if a player has won the game. The question was a little vague but not difficult. I solved it easily.
        </p>
        <p>Round 2: 
        You are given a grid with random characters. You are also provided with a dictionary. You need to find all the words you can build on the board. Words may appear more frequently. You can go up, down left, and right on the board. Return a dictionary with words as key and plural as a number. This was a combination of coding and design questions. I was asked to write a Pseudocode and design an API. This question was confusing, difficult, and continued to change as the conversation progressed.
        I solved it by creating Trie in the dictionary and started DFS on all the letters in the grid.
        </p>
        <p>Round 3: 
        This was a very interesting discussion. It was not a non-technical round. This discussion was hosted by the Prime Minister. He told me what the Prime Minister did at Apple. He then gave me a guess project. He asked me to include ratings of rotten tomatoes in response to Siri’s video. This was a vague requirement as you can find. He asked me how I was going to handle such a task.
        I talked about clarifying needs, came up with a performance description, telemtry to measure project success, and discussed day-to-day details in the development phase. We discussed stakeholder engagement, top-down, stakeholder engagement, conflict resolution, and expectations management.
        5-10 minutes ago, you asked about a fantasy project I would like to do. I discussed digital input scent and touch.
        </p>
        <p>Round 4: 
        This was a technical cycle. I had to use a dictionary. This was a vague question, and we discussed various issues such as hashing performance, conflict resolution, loading feature, and dictionary extension when it is overcrowded. I used a standard dictionary in C # using Lists.
        His last question was about a feature I would like to use in a hackathon. I suggested that the maps for each turn should not provide direction to known routes.
        </p>
        <p>Round 5: 
        Use the IsPalidrome function. You actually used the code for a few inputs. There were many edge cases but how difficult can IsPalindrome be? He then asked me to do a rope-taking job such as installing and retrieving points depending on how different you are from the Palindrome. This was a vague question and I interpreted how often it would take to install and remove the cable concealment in Palindrome. I suggested a DP solution. The interviewer was not sure if it would work but did not know if it would work. I have made several variations of this issue.
        </p>
        <p>Round 6:
        This round was with the manager. We talked about leadership, projects, the team’s charter, Apple’s culture, tech stack, compensation, career growth, and many other things. 
        This round was about me interviewing the team and company.</p>`,

        topic: `<p><strong>About Company</strong></p><p>Barclays is a global British 
        bank located in London, England. Barclays is divided into two divisions: 
        Barclays UK and Barclays International, which are supported by a service 
        firm called Barclays Execution Services. Barclays is a constituent of the FTSE 
        100 Index and has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange. It has a secondary listing 
        on the New York Stock Exchange. According to a 2011 report, Barclays was the most powerful 
        transnational business in terms of ownership and consequently corporate control over global 
        financial stability and market competitiveness, with Axa and State Street Corporation claiming 
        the second and third spots, respectively.</p><p><strong>
        Recruitment Process:</strong></p><ul><li>Round 1: Online Assessment</li><li>Round 2: Technical + 
        HR Interview</li></ul><p><strong>Barclays Eligibility Criteria: </strong>Graduation(BE/B.Tech): 
        CS & IT students from Final year, with ≥ 60% score across class X, XII, and engineering semesters.
        </p><p><strong>Round 1: &nbsp;Online Assessment</strong></p><ul><li>This round was a proctored 
        test of 90 mins on the HackerEarth platform which consisted of 2 Sections- Technical MCQs and 
        Coding.&nbsp;</li><li>There were a total of 30 MCQs and each of the MCQs was of either 4 or 6 
        points.&nbsp;</li><li>There was a 4-6 Output-based MCQs on STL C++, Java, and Python. 
        Apart from this, a few questions also included the CS Fundamentals including OOPS, SQL, 
        DBMS, and OS.</li><li>The coding section consisted of 2 questions. The questions were:
        <br><strong>The Minimum Sum:</strong> Given an array&nbsp;
        .Your task is to minimize the sum of the final array and print the minimum sum. (20 marks).
        <br><strong>Max Divisor Tree:</strong> Given a tree with the root value N, 
        what is the maximum height the tree can have? The property of the tree is that 
        each of its nodes branches out to the nodes with a value equal to one of its divisors 
        (except 1 and the number itself). (50 marks)</li></ul><p>One thing which is very important in 
        this round is proper time management as you have to do well in both sections to maximize your 
        chances of getting shortlisted.</p><p>Around 302 students had applied and 34 students were shortlisted. 
        I was one of them and the interview was scheduled for the next day. The interviewer was a VP at Barclays.
        </p><p><strong>Round 2: Technical + HR Interview (40 mins)</strong></p><ul><li>Please tell me about yourself.
        </li><li>Brief description of the project.</li><li>What is the future scope of your project & Challenges are faced?
        </li><li>As my project is based on DBMS, he asked me how to fetch data from the back end.</li><li>
        Questions on DBMS like the definition of DML & DDL, their commands & their queries.</li><li>
        What is indexing & clustering? How to implement it on a given dataset.</li><li>What is the primary key, 
        foreign key & candidate key?</li><li>How was your coding profile, what languages do you know?</li><li>A 
        brief discussion on OOPs concepts.&nbsp;</li><li>The real-life situation on how will you verify a terrorist 
        if he/she wants to open an account on our portal.</li><li>What do you know about Barclays?</li></ul><p><strong>
        Interview Experience:</strong> It is always beneficial if you know what it is to be there at that moment. 
        Be confident & try to give real-life situations examples. Also, try to use mathematical terms, 
        it makes a good impression on the interviewer. At last, the interviewer told that it was nice talking with you.
        </p><p>On the same day, the results are out.</p><p><strong>Verdict: Out of 24 selected students, 
        I was one among them.</strong></p><p><strong>Tips:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Be Ambitious</li><li>
        Do not lie in your resume at all. Mention only those things about which you’ll be confident and comfortable enough 
        to have a discussion.</li><li>Life isn&#8217;t fair to everyone at all times, But that doesn&#8217;t mean we should be 
        paranoid or disappointed. Learning to accept life as it comes is a sure-shot success to contentment. &nbsp;</li>

        topic: `<p>De Shaw visited our Campus at the beginning of July and this was the process they followed:
        </p><p><strong>Online Screening Round</strong></p><div id=GFG_AD_gfg_mobile_336x280></div><p>
        It consisted of a variety of questions.</p><ul><li>Aptitude Section (14 MCQs, 28 minutes)</li>
        <li>Technical Section (12 MCQs, 17 minutes)</li><li>Coding Section (2 questions, 50 minutes)</li>
        </ul><p>The first question was the simple array-based sorting question, Leetcode Easy level &#8211; 
        20 mins</p><p>The second question however was a very lengthy and interesting tree-based question. &#8211; 30 mins<br>
        Reading and understanding the questions themselves took around 10 mins, so a maximum number of students didn&#8217;t 
        finish this question. This was a medium-hard question but was very lengthy to type and debug.</p><p><strong>1st 
        Interview Round: </strong>There were two interviewers, and the interview was quite challenging. It consisted of a 
        Design Question that involved OS concepts, and a Medium level DSA question, which could be solved using an ordered map 
        of pairs.</p><p><strong>Question</strong>: From a given text, identify various words and prove that the frequency of the 
        words is inversely proportional to the rank of the words. Lower the rank more the frequency.</p><p><strong>Solution:
        </strong>Using a map of strings to int, maintain all the count of words, now sort it to find ranks. Now multiply 
        the rank with the frequency, considering the text is huge this will result in a constant value,</p><p>After that I 
        was asked for some mathematical puzzles which are as follows:</p><p><strong>1.</strong> If there are n tennis players, 
        and we are organizing a knockout-type tournament, find the total number of matches, maximum matches played by the winner, 
        and maximum matches played by the 2nd runner.</p><p><strong>Solution: </strong>I didn&#8217;t mug up any formula for this,
         I simply derived the answer for a smaller test case like 3 and 4. And using the observed pattern, I could easily extrapolate 
         it for a generalized case and it was correct. It will also help in keeping the communication between you and the interviewer 
         in a good flow and everyone will understand the method used.<br>Here the answer was: Total matches -> n/2 + n/4 + n/8 + 
         &#8230; + 1<br>And the maximum number of matches that a winner could play was:<strong> </strong>log2(n)</p><p><strong>2.
         </strong> If there is a football tournament with n teams, find a total number of matches played considering that each 
         team plays with every other team, one match on their home ground and the other being away. This round also had some 
         HR components within it. I didn&#8217;t do very well with the design part, so I was quite skeptical about my selection
          for the next round. But fortunately, I made it.</p><p><strong>Solution: </strong>I followed a similar approach for 
          this question as well, when the number of teams is 3: Matches played is 3*2 = 6<br>Column: Home ground of a particular
           team</p><div style="text-align:center;margin:20px 0" id=GFG_AD_gfg_outstream_incontent></div><figure class=table><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>T1</strong></td><td><strong>T2</strong></td><td><strong>T3</strong></td></tr><tr><td>vs T2</td><td>vs T1</td><td>vs T1</td></tr><tr><td>vs T3</td><td>vs T3</td><td>vs T2</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Similarly for 4 teams: we will have 4*3 = 12</p><p>So the answer was: n * (n-1)</p><p><strong>2nd Interview Round: </strong>This round had two DSA questions and a design question.</p><ul><li>It was a knapsack-up question, not very obvious, but it could be brought down to that. The solution was very similar to this</li></ul><p><a href=https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/0-1-knapsack-problem0945/1>https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/0-1-knapsack-problem0945/1</a></p><ul><li>Involves double stack and transferring items from one to the other based on the inputs or actions required. I had to design a browser history system that would work based on the &#8220;go back button&#8221; and &#8220;forward button&#8221; of a browser. It was the first time I encountered such a question and had a fun time solving it.</li></ul><p>Here&#8217;s a related article you can check out:<br><a href=https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementing-backward-and-forward-buttons-of-browser/>https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementing-backward-and-forward-buttons-of-browser/</a></p><p>I was then asked to design a class diagram and association for an Alexa system for the home. I did well in this interview and was pretty confident about my selection.</p><p><strong>Result:</strong> I got the selection mail two days later!</p><p><strong>Pro Tips:</strong></p><ul><li>Unlike other companies De Shaw conducts its interviews in a coding platform itself, so your code needs to pass all test cases. So have a good grasp of the syntax and follow best practices while coding. You should be comfortable solving Medium level questions within 20 mins and must at least be able to come up with a good approach for Hard Questions.</li><li>Pay attention to your CS Fundamentals (OS, DBMS, OOPS), they will play a crucial role in the selection process.</li></ul><p>Good luck!</p><div class=textBasedMannualAds_2></div><div id=personalNoteDiv class="clear hideIt"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class=noteHeaderText>My Personal Notes</span>

        </strong>Online test was conducted on the Codility platform. There were 3 questions which are to be 
        solved in 1.5 hours.</p><div id=GFG_AD_gfg_mobile_336x280></div><ul><li>1st Question is a basic array 
        and sorting implementation.</li><li>2nd Question in Medium 2d-DP question. ( Not a standard Question)
        </li><li>3rd Question is a DP question again wherein you have to find a proper substring of a given substring which is both a suffix and prefix.
        <br>I have solved 1st question and 2nd questions completely and the 3rd one with 70 to 80 percent.</li></ul>
        <p><strong>Note: </strong>You need to submit your code on basis of example test cases only once submitted 
        cannot be changed, So take good care of all edge cases.</p><p>18 were qualified for 2nd round.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Round(1st tech interview-1hr): </strong>It started with an intro from both sides, then we have to choose a programming language we are comfortable with. I choose C++, and he asked me questions related to C++ and went deep to understand my depth in the same. Then questions on DBMS(acid properties, different types of key, query of 3rd highest salary), OS(scheduling algorithms, process, threads), Computer networks(OSI layer, difference between TCP and UDP, VPN, Etc.), and OOPS. Then he gave 1 pseudocode and asked for the output. Finally, he asked for 2 DSA problems both were easy but they checked for an optimized solution, and time complexity is important.</p><p>Finally, only 10 moved to 3rd round and I was one among them.</p><p>DSA Problems are-</p><ul><li>Longest Common Substring of String Sequence</li><li>Print the left view of Binary Tree</li></ul><p><strong>3rd Round(2nd tech interview-1hr): </strong>First was intro then he asked a DSA problem to solve, I gave a brute force approach but couldn’t give an optimized solution the interviewer was not helpful and he skipped it after a few minutes and he asked some technical questions on OS, DBMS, Networks, etc. Unfortunately, I was not qualified in this round, and the other person qualified for the next round.</p><p>4 students are qualified for this round.</p><p><strong>4th Round(Hr interview 30min):</strong> The other person who qualified for this round was told that it was a non-elimination round and standard HR questions were asked like</p><ul><li>Tell me about yourself</li><li>What are your strengths and weaknesses</li><li>Do you have any offers?</li><li>Why Hashedin?</li></ul><div class=textBasedMannualAds_2></div><div id=personalNoteDiv class="clear hideIt"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class=noteHeaderText>My Personal Notes</span>
